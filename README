No working code was introduced. Only snippets.

AGENDA:
1. Keeping project wide constants in a separate file.
2. Consistency in project structure.
   - To be further researched: State management: Context API, Zustand, Redux
3. Well structured project, by using Components for reusable and/or distinct UI elements.
4. Avoid unnecessary <div></div> by using <></>.
5. Don't add layout styles to reusable components. Options to use:
   - wrapping with <div></div>
   - className prop which gets merged with the reusable one
